1. Peel (if needed) and mix ① in mixer's bowl
	1. *Might try bumping up the salt since it needed a bit more at the end*
	2. Sample mix of vegetable, equally-ish divided:
		1. Parsnip
		2. Rutabaga
		3. Chigga beet
		4. Japanese sweet potato
		5. Carrot
2. Melt butter from ② in saucepan. Whisk in miso and avocado oil
	1. *Try dropping total fat to ~4.5%*
	2. *Maybe try adding miso coating at the end? Would reduce crispiness but maintain probiotics*
3. Pour ② into bowl with vegetables. Stir to coat.
4. Spread mixture on rimmed baking sheet
5. Convection bake @ 390F for ~45 min or until lightly browned, stirring halfway
	1. *Can go up to maybe 425F for a bit to get more browning but don't want to burn the butter. Need to figure out exact timing with a non-crowded pan*
