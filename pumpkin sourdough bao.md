## Bao buns

|     | Ingredients        | Weight | Baker's % |
| --- | ------------------ | ------ | --------- |
| ①   | Pumpkin puree      | 228g   |           |
|     | Starter            | 200g   |           |
|     | Nonfat milk powder | 45g    |           |
| ②   | Bread flour        | 347g   |           |
|     | Cane sugar         | 59.5g  |           |
|     | Brown sugar        | 25.5g  |           |
|     | Potato starch      | 55g    |           |
|     | Avocado oil        | 20g    |           |
|     | Salt               | 10g    |           |
|     |                    |        |           |
|     | Yield              | ~1kg   |           |
1. Combine ① in mixer's bowl and mix mostly homogenous
2. Add ②. Mix on low to a shaggy mass. Mix on medium to full gluten development
	1. *This took ~17 minutes on my Famag for 4kg and heated up the dough considerably. Figure out how to reduce this.*
3. Transfer to oiled bowl. Bulk ferment at room temp for 2h with no folds.
	1. *This seems long. I bulk ferment bagel dough like this for an hour then move to shaping. Might be able to decrease this. Dough feels similar in consistency to bagel dough, maybe slightly less stiff.*
4. Divide and shape. I used 70g for filled steamed buns and 80g for folded mantou.
5. Final proof at room temp for 1-2h. Aim for 1h or less if filled with meat.
6. Cold proof in fridge overnight. My fridge is at ~36F so am able to steam them anywhere between the next day and +2 days at least.
7. Steam for 15 min in combi oven.

1. Combine ① in bowl and mix. Pour into vacuum bag.
2. Add turkey and seal. Work marinade around to cover the turkey.
3. Sous vide @ 153F for ~2.5 hr (time depends on thickness, see relevant timing charts)
4. Remove breasts and reserve marinade. Shred turkey
5. Optionally drizzle some marinade on turkey to make slightly more moist. Can also reduce the marinade to form a sauce for folded mantous.

## Cranberry Hoisin
I didn't change anything here from The Takeout's recipe. Don't add too much water or it takes forever to reduce. I 2x'd this for 52 buns.

|     | Ingredients           | Weight                   | Volume    |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| ①   | Fresh cranberries     |                          | 473 ml    |
|     | Fresh ginger (peeled) |                          | ~2 cm nub |
|     | Star anise            |                          | 1 pod     |
|     | Salt                  |                          | 2.5 ml    |
|     | Black pepper          |                          | 3.75 ml   |
|     | Water                 |                          | As needed |
|     | Hoisin sauce          |                          | 120 ml    |
1. Add everything but the hoisin sauce to a pot. Add water to *just* cover the cranberries. They float so don't be deceived. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 10 min. 
2. Once done remove ginger and star anise. I didn't add any sugar or more salt/pepper here.
3. Blend until smooth with immersion blender (or mash or blender or whatever you choose).
